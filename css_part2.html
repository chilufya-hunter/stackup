<h2>how to read carefully</h2>
<p>
    Printed texts may be accompanied by illustrations, photographs and diagrams,
    while digital texts can use many more <em>"added extras,"</em> including audio and video
    elements, quizzes, and links to other texts.
</p>
<h2>how to code in solidity</h2>
<p>
    As a relatively young language, Solidity is <em>advancing</em> at a rapid speed. We aim for 
    a regular (non-breaking) release every 2-3 weeks, with approximately two breaking 
    releases per year. You can follow the implementation status of new features in the
    Solidity Github project
</p>
<h2>how to use git</h2>
<p>
    A quick aside: git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version
    <emcontrol</em> tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub 
    is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need
    GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git.
